To me, version control means having a reliable and organized way to track changes in my work over time. It allows me to experiment freely without the fear of losing previous progress, since every update is recorded and reversible. Version control also makes collaboration easier by letting multiple people work on the same project without overwriting each other’s contributions. Overall, it gives structure, safety, and clarity to the development process.
